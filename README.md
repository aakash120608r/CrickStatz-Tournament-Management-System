    ```

---

- **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'prettytable'`

    ‚ûù Install PrettyTable for tabular output:

---

- **Error:** `Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' is not supported`

    ‚ûù This happens with MySQL 8+. Fix it by switching to the native password plugin:
    ```sql
    ALTER USER 'your_username'@'localhost' 
    IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
    Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your own credentials.

---

- **Error:** `Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)`

    ‚ûù Ensure you are using the correct username and password when prompted.  
    ‚ûù If you forgot your MySQL root password, reset it using MySQL secure installation or your MySQL Workbench.

---

- **Error:** `Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' (10061)`

    ‚ûù MySQL server is not running.  
    - Start the MySQL service manually:
      - On Windows: Search for **Services**, find **MySQL**, and click **Start**.  
      - On Linux/macOS:  
        ```bash
        sudo service mysql start

---

- **Error:** `Error during database initialization: 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'crickstatz'`

    ‚ûù Normally, the app auto-creates the database. If this appears:
    - Check that your MySQL user has permission to create databases.  
    - If not, create it manually:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE crickstatz;
      ```

---

- **Error:** `Duplicate entry 'X' for key 'PRIMARY'`

    ‚ûù You are trying to insert a record with the same primary key (like re-adding the same player/team).  
    - Fix: Ensure you‚Äôre entering unique IDs or names.  
    - Use the **View Records** option before adding new ones.

---

- **Error:** `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''`

    ‚ûù This happens if you leave an input empty when an integer is required.  
    - Fix: Always provide a valid number, or if the field is optional, press Enter only where allowed.

---

- **Error:** Predictions not showing any results

    ‚ûù This means there‚Äôs no historical match data for the player/team you selected.  
    - Add some matches and stats first, then try predicting again.

---
